Assignment 01:
---------------
1) Read the notes of Day001_Notes.txt
2) Try to create an empty java project
    File > New > java project
3) Then follow the steps in Day001_Notes.txt and add Maven support to it.

Note: For students using other IDEs like Eclipse,
I would request to check the steps in google
"To add Maven support to existing Java project in Eclipse" and steps neatly
in the Day001_Notes.txt with Eclipse Heading.
