When I have created empty repository in the GITHUB and cloned to my local,
then we don't have the support of the Maven by default, to enable Maven
on existing tool, we will be following above steps.

How to add Maven support to already existing empty project?
IntelliJ IDEA
1) Open IntelliJ IDEA and load your existing project (e.g., a Java project).
2) In the Project tool window,
select the module or project directory to which you want to add Maven.
3) Press Ctrl + Shift + A (or Cmd + Shift + A on macOS) to open the Find Action dialog.
4) Type “Add Framework Support” and select the corresponding action.
5) In the Add Framework Support dialog,
choose Maven from the options on the left and click OK.
6) IntelliJ IDEA will add a default POM (Project Object Model)
to your project and generate the standard Maven layout in the Project tool window.
7) It will also create a corresponding structure with Lifecycle and
Plugins in the Maven tool window.
8) Open the generated pom.xml file and specify a groupId.
The artifactId and version are automatically set.
9) Make all further project changes in the pom.xml,
as IntelliJ IDEA treats it as the single source of truth for
Maven-related configurations.
